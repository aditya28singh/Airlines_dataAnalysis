# **Airlines Occupancy and Revenue Analysis**

## **Project Overview**

This project aims to analyze airline data to improve **occupancy rates**, optimize **pricing strategies**, and increase overall profitability. The airline operates a diverse fleet of aircraft and faces challenges such as rising operational costs, stricter environmental regulations, and increased labor expenses. This project seeks to identify opportunities for enhancing profitability through data analysis.

## **Business Problem**

Our company operates a diverse fleet of aircraft ranging from small business jets to medium-sized machines. We have been providing high-quality air transportation services to our clients for several years, and our primary focus is to ensure a **safe, comfortable, and convenient journey** for our passengers. However, we are currently facing challenges due to several factors such as:

- **Stricter environmental regulations** leading to higher costs.
- **Higher flight taxes** imposed by governments.
- **Tight labor market**, increasing labor costs.
- **Rising fuel prices** and overall operational expenses.

As a result, the company's profitability is under pressure, and we are seeking ways to address this issue. To tackle this challenge, we are conducting a data analysis to find ways to **increase our occupancy rate**, which can help boost the average profit earned per seat.

## **Main Challenges**

1. **Stricter Environmental Regulations**: Growing demand to reduce the airline industryâ€™s carbon footprint has led to stringent environmental laws, increasing operational costs.
2. **Higher Flight Taxes**: To address environmental concerns and generate revenue, heavier taxes on flights are being imposed worldwide, raising costs.
3. **Tight Labor Market**: A shortage of trained personnel has driven up labor costs and turnover rates.
4. **Rising Fuel Prices**: The increasing fuel prices add pressure to the airline's profitability.

## **Objectives**

1. **Increase Occupancy Rates**: By raising occupancy rates, we can enhance the average profit per seat and alleviate the impact of the challenges we're facing.
2. **Improve Pricing Strategy**: Develop a pricing strategy considering market conditions and customer preferences to attract and retain customers.
3. **Enhance Customer Experience**: Focus on delivering a seamless and convenient experience for our customers to foster loyalty.

## **Basic Analysis**

The basic analysis of data provides insights into:

- The number of planes with more than 100 seats.
- Changes in ticket bookings and revenue over time.
- Average fares for different aircraft under different conditions.

This analysis will help develop strategies to optimize occupancy rates and pricing. The table below shows the aircraft with more than 100 seats and the actual seat count.

| **Aircraft Code** | **Number of Seats** |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| 319               | 116                 |
| 320               | 140                 |
| 321               | 170                 |
| 733               | 130                 |
| 763               | 222                 |
| 773               | 402                 |

## **Trend Analysis**

We utilized a line chart visualization to track **ticket bookings** and **revenue** trends over time. From June 22nd to July 7th, ticket bookings gradually increased, followed by a stable pattern, with a noticeable peak in bookings and revenue. This analysis helps to identify factors that contribute to the peak in bookings, allowing further optimization of revenue and operational strategies.

### **Average Cost Analysis**

We generated a bar graph to compare the average cost associated with different fare conditions (business, economy, comfort). The business class consistently shows higher fares across all planes. The **comfort class** is only available on the 773 aircraft, while the **CN1 and CR2** aircraft only offer economy class.

## **Occupancy Rate Analysis**

Airlines must thoroughly analyze revenue streams to maximize profitability. The key metrics include **total yearly revenue**, **average revenue per ticket**, and **occupancy rate** for each aircraft. Below is a table showing the revenue, ticket count, and average revenue per ticket for each aircraft.
